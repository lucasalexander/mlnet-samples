# sentiment-analysis
This is a sample solution based on the ML.NET [sentiment analysis tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/machine-learning/tutorials/sentiment-analysis). Once the project is compiled, the user can supply a command-line argument of either "train" or "predict." In "train" mode, the program will ask the user to provide paths to a training dataset and an evaluation dataset in order to train and evaluate a model. The evaluation results will be displayed to the user, and the model will be saved to a user-specified location on disk. In "predict" mode, the program will ask the user to provide the path to a trained model file and a fragment of text to analyze for sentiment. The text will be analyzed, and the result will be displayed to the user.
